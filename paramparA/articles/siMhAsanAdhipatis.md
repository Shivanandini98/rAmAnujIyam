The boy stopped him on the way. Holding a handful of sand in his closed fist, he asked the Panditha how much of sand was there in his palm. The Panditha was nonplussed and asked how could anyone count the sands. Parasara retorted saying that if he could not answer that it was just a 'fistful' how did he propose to win an argument with the great Ramanuja. The Panditha praised the boy, his father Kuresa and his Acharya, Embar. The Panditha subsequently became the disciple of Parasara assuming the name of ' Per Arulala Perumal Emperumanar'  

Parasara and his brother helped the master in the documenting the Sribhashya. (p.315 of GLE). When the master bade Embar to bring the baby for naming, Embar brought the baby and by way of protection was muttering Dvaya Mantram. When the master enquired how the baby showed off an unusual brilliance, Embar narrated what he did on the way. The master exclaimed that he had prevented Koorathaalwaan from being the Guru for the baby since only the one who initiates in Dvaya would be the Acharya. Since he had done this, the master asked Embar to act as the Guru for the baby. (p.32-33 0f ATA). p.33-34 of ATA) His TANIAN runs as follows:'(SAA p.199)
