Srimad Rahasyatrayasára is a classic of the first importance to the followers of Sri Vedāntadesika. Though it is in Tamil, it is so full of Sanskrit words and of Sanskrit passages quoted as praianas that the ordinary reader finds ir difficult to understand it by himself. Since a number of my friends who have studied English told me that an English translation of it would be of great help. I suggested to Professor M. R. Rajagopala Ayyaṅgār who is well-versed in: Sri Bhashya, Rahasyatrayasara and other works connected with the tradition of Sri Vaishnavism and has, in addition, an intimate knowledge of English, that he might undertake the work. He complied with my request, completed the transla tion and handed it over to me. It is not possible for me to thank him in adequate terms for having done so. 

In getting the work through the Press, I have received great and enthusiastic help from Sri K. V. Rāmaswami, B. A., Assistant Secretary, Mettur Chemicals and Sri R. Natarajan, B.Sc., Secretary of the Mettur Chemicals. I take this oppor tunity of expressing my deep gratitude to them. 

I am also thankful to the Sree Vedānta Desika Sampra daya Sabha, Bombay for having kindly lent the block of Sree Vedānta Desika appearing in the book. 

My grateful thanks are due to Sri K. Vasudevan Nair, Proprietor, The Literary Press, Salem who is well-known for his deep interest in everything that concerns our religion, for his ready and willing co-operation in the printing of the book in his press.
