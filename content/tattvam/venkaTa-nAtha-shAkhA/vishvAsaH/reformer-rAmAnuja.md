## Data
### tanjamma story
tanjamma story (denying sheSha - not uchChiShTa- of his non-v1 teacher to R) and such are reliable (though it's been boosted to the point of making it about some "social reform" thing). The recorders are near-contemporaries. As far as rAmAnuja was concerned he was acting within the confines of varNAshrama-dharma, as was his wife (albeit overly influenced by shiShTAchAra and less by actual shAstra study). Ditto with mantra-broadcast story.

The yajnopavIta granting story ("8 yo R did so to perform antya-karma to a v4"), quoted as "family record" by K shrIkRShNa, is utterly insane - not from any reliable record. As a matter of fact, it is well known that R questioned his teacher about him performing final rites (without violating shAstra but violating common practice) to a v4 student and receiving a satisfactory answer citing final rite to jaTAyuSh by rAma.

## Hype
"Statue of equality" hype and quotes in its website are not reliable. All orthodox shrIvaiShNava-s - definitely all belonging to the vaDakalai sect detest such lies, even if it is good propaganda to bring wokes into dharma.

## Instructions of Agamas
The following injuctions about adherence to varNAshrama-dharma are heavily quoted by R, VD etc..

> “अविप्लवाय धर्माणां पालनाय कुलस्य च ।  
संग्रहाय च लोकस्य मर्यादास्थापनाय च ॥  
प्रियाय मम विष्णोश्च देवदेवस्य शार्ङ्गिणः ।  
मनीषी वैदिकाचारं मनसापि न लङ्घयेत्” 
(लक्ष्मीतन्त्रम् 17-93,-94.)


> “श्रुतिस्स्मृतिर्ममैवाज्ञा  
> यस्तामुल्लङ्घ्य वर्तते ।  
> आज्ञाच्छेदी मम द्रोही  
> मद्भक्तोऽपि न वैष्णवः”  
> (विष्णुधर्मम् 6-31.) 

However, special allowance is made for bhAgavata-s -

> यः शूद्रं भगवद्-भक्तं  
निषादं श्वपचं तथा ।  
वीक्षते जाति-सामान्यात्  
स याति नरकं नरः ॥  

> "A devotee of the Lord, who may be a 'sudra' or a forester or a low caste man should not be treated on counts of caste. If one does so, he will fall into hell"

> चण्डालम् अपि वृत्त-स्थं  
तं देवा ब्राह्मणं विदुः ।  
चण्डालाः प्रत्यवसिताः  
परिव्राजक-तापसाः ॥

> न शूद्रा भगवद्भक्ता  
विप्रा भागवताः स्मृताः ।  
सर्व-वर्णेषु ते शूद्रा  
ये ह्य् अभक्ता जनार्दने ॥

Of course, this does not mean there was "yajnopavIta distribution" for them - that would violate "श्रुतिस्स्मृतिर्ममैवाज्ञा".

## Conclusion
shrI rAmAnuja was NOT a social reformer in the sense of violating express statements of the shAstra. Yet, he, like is predecessors, were all for extending full  courtesy to shrIvaiShNavas - exactly as the Agamas enjoined.
