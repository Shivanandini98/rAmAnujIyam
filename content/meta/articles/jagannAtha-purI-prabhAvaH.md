Shri Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva Maharaja. The first prominent Ramanujadasa of Odisha . Under him , Srimandira underwent some changes that are now the hallmark of it.

The Lakshmi temple ,Sridevi and Bhudevi with Bhagavan and the kitchen are his influence (neighbouring states have all Saraswati with Vishnu).  
Also the chalanti pratima concept and the mock quarrel between Lakshmi and Narayana as Bachanika .  
These are common in Pancharatrika temples of the South  too .

It used to be only Pancharatra once, as the Brahma Purana tells us, but now it is a mixture of a lot of vidhans ,including Pancharatra. There is Kapila Samhita and Vamadeva Samhita ,Gopalarchancapaddhati by Gajapati Purushottamadeva perhaps.

> They follow hayashirsha panchratra and also hari bhakti vilas for many rituals specially during nabkalevar.  the vanayaga etc. and homa with Patalanarasimha mantra (400 akshara mantra) are obvious rituals of Hayashirsha pancharatra.
